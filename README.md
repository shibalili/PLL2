Systemin was identified in 1991 as the first plant signaling peptide, and is required for defense against insect herbivores in tomato plants. Systemin was first perceived as a hormone-like, long-distance messenger mediating the activation of systemic defense responses far from the site of insect attack. It was later shown to rather act as a phytocytokine, amplifying the local wound response for production of downstream signals resulting in defense gene activation in distal tissues. Systemin perception and signaling rely on the systemin receptor SYR1. However, SYR1-dependent signaling, and how systemin signaling differs from other peptide-mediated signaling pathways, is largely unknown.
